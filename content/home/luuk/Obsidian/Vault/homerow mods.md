# My journey

 I started using homerowmods in the style described in that github page above, for almost 3 weeks I'd say, and I have gotten mostly used to it. There is a quirck I noticed though, I cannot hold control with my r key and scroll and have it work, for it does nothing while held until another key is pressed, or just sends the r key when released, this is quirky.

 I always used the thumb clusters on my [[Glove80]] to press shift and control, I still use them for shift, as the timings involved with getting shift right on the homerow is tricky while typing, so I don't have to worry about that this way. Generally speaking, you don't use alt, and control in your general typing flow.  

# Spacebar mod
Alongside my homerow mods I have a spacebar mod, that when held activates my symbol layer on the left hand. I am not fully convinced of this yet, it is nice but when rapidly switching between a symbol and regular text it can be tricky to get the timings right. If I want to say x = 5, that's fine and I can do it without skipping much of a beat, but sometimes you're typing really quick and want to type a bracket and it missfires. I will have to maybe tweak the timings a little better.
