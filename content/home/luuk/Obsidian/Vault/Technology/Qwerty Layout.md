The origins of the qwerty [[keyboard layout]]
# Youtube 
I found  a video by a Youtuber called  [[Atomic Frontier ( Youtuber )]]  in which he [explains](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=188fipF-i5I&t=716s) the true history of the qwerty layout and it is fascinating and kind of annoying.  

# Printing Telegraph
The [[Printing Telegraph]] was invented in 1846 by [[Electrician R.E House]]
It had its keys layed out from left to right in alphabetical order, it could send entire letters instead of morse code.

In 1855 [[David Hughes, pianist]]  combined it with the concept of a [[piano]], because that's what people  knew, to create something like this:

# The typewriter
1868 three people used this device as the foundation for the [[typewriter]]
They swapped the piano keys for rounded buttons, they decided to move the vowels up to the top row. Symbols got added on top of that. The keys were pushed together and "staggered to leave room for mechanical linkages" that's a quote from the video, which is excellent by the way so go watch it. 

The arms of a typewriter that connected the keys had to be staggered, as opposed to on top of each other ([[ortholinear key layout]]) otherwise the mechanism wouldn't work. 

This was the one of the first layouts they ended up with in **1870**.

The inventors wanted to sell it to [[American Telegraph Works]] . They wanted some modification though.  Now comes a fascinating tidbit , what they  did was move the letter I which at the time functioned as the number 1 symbol, next to the letter 8, so they could type the year 1870 more quickly. Think about this for a second, we still have that letter "i"  ( the fifth most used letter in English: [[letter frequencies]]) there today because people in the late 1800s needed to type their year more rapidly. It is insanity that this persists but I digress. 
( Obviously they would never expect that letter I to remain there a 150 years later , because why would it, but it's a perfect example of how  [[things stay around longer than you might expect]] which is something I think engineers or designers of all kinds really need to keep in mind )

They then went ahead and moved the letter s closer to the letter z and e because of a common confusion between the letter z in morse code and se, I don't get this from the video but I am leaving that fact in this text because reasons beyond me.

So what started with essentially an alphabetically sorted list of characters, with some shuffling here and there to make the lives of typists a bit easier , became this:

This design was then copied by other manufacturers because people got used to this initial typewriter layout. 

However, in order to not infringe on the creator's patent, they had to shuffle the letters a bit again, and that is how we ended up with our Qwerty layout.

After a while manufactures agreed to standardize to this layout and here we are. 

The youtuber relates this to a [[hill climbing algorithm]]. This also relates a little bit to [[gradient descent]] or [[local minima/maxima]]. It could even be related to how in life it's easy to grow used to and kind of [[being okay with a meh situation]]. The effort it would take to get out of it would be larger than you are up to in that moment, this is not the note to delve into that though.

Once people got used to this layout, it would be very hard for another manufacturer to come around and say "well actually looking at letters we use most frequently , maybe we could do better, and potentially prevent a lot of [[RSI]] in the future for the billions of people that will use this thing" .


Oh I went into a slight rant there. Anyway, that's probably a decent history on the lay-out. I think I will elaborate on [[keyboard layout]] in general.
