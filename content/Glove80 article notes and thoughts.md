So I want to write more about my [[Glove80]] and here I am just going to roughly sketch what I'd want to say. 

# Build
I think I want to go over the fact that it is lightweight:

- talk about the feet slipping, fixable with a mat
- the tenting being a little finicky but the bolts fix that problem
- the light weight nature is great
- the case is good, but it is bulky so you will get memed
# Keywells
I want to go into the keywells, along with the [[ortholinear key layout]] that makes things nicer. I can go into detail on how a normal keyboard forces you to do finger gymnastics

# Layout
Talk about being able to have any [[keyboard layout]] you would like, I chose [[Colemak-DH]] which is a rabbit hole in and of itself.
# Programmable
It uses  [[ZMK firmware]] which lets you do a ton of interesting stuff. 

## Home row mods
I can discuss the use of [[homerow mods]] with zmk, referring to [this guide](https://github.com/urob/zmk-config#timerless-homerow-mods), which is freaking goated:  as it 
## Layers 
symbol layers, number layers, mouse layers, function layers, these are all things that I could discuss nicely I think.
