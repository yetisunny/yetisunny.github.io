So I like the idea of publishing my [[Obsidian]] notes, or at least being able to select some of my notes that I can easily share with the world and my friends. 

# Obsidian Quartz
This is a tool that should just do everything for me
https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/

Could I build something myself? Possibly, but that might be more effort than it's worth, I want this site to be pretty simple and shouldn't have much custom stuff.

# My site
As of 2025-06-21 I have a site with quartz: [My notes](notes.yetisunny.nl)  , I am not happy with the styling yet, nor the layout, but it is a start. I also worked with my friend [[ChatGPT]] to create a go program that lets me sync certain notes I mark with a "published":"true/false" tag , only those are then hosted. 

I still need to schedule this and automate the publishing of it, but is is a start.
