# Split Ergo Keyboards
Up until fairly recently I never I knew these sorts of keyboards existed. I knew about so called "Ergonomic Keyboards" , they never actually looked very ergonomic to me. However, a keyboard  where each hand has it's own half that can be positioned freely was new to me. I was intrigued. 
This led me to go down a rabbit hole that went so much deeper than I initially thought  
# The ergonomic keyboard rabbit hole

For this story the keyboard I will use as a reference is the MoErgo Glove80, however most all principles apply to other keyboards of the same nature. This is mostly a deep dive into why you might even consider going down this same rabbit hole as me :)

The Glove80 is an [[ergonomic]]  [[split keyboard]]. The split and [[ortholinear]] nature  means itâ€™s much more comfortable to type on and has allowed me to get into the following things:

-  Use [Vim Motions & Modal editing]] 
-  Use a tiling window manager such as [[Hyprland]] with ease.
-  Use much more keyboard shortcuts in general

## Ulnar Deviation
A problem traditional slab keyboards have is that of "*Ulnar Deviation*" where your wrist is forced to  be rotated in order to rest on the keys. This is often a big part of [[RSI]].

A split keyboard prevents this as you can angle each board in such a way where you avoid this problem all-together and can keep your wrists in a neutral position.
## Scapular Protraction
Usually keyboards come in one piece, however this pretty much requires us to take on an uncomfortable posture with our shoulder blades :  "[[Scapular Protraction]]" where you have to squeeze your chest together.

So the MoErgo Glove80 fixes both of these problems by virtue of splitting both halves. However, then there's the problem of the row stagger:
## Row Stagger vs Ortholinear
### Row stagger

The keys are offset per each row
### Ortholinear or Columnar Stagger

The keys are not offset per row but stacked on top of each other

When learning the "textbook" method of ten-finger typing you are supposed to hit the c key with your middle finger, however, at least for me, when I bend my middle finger down, it finds itself squarely in the middle of the c and the x key. On an ortho layout however, there is no confusion as to which finger is supposed to hit which key, for just bending your finger downward and seeing where it ends up will tell  you. 

## Key-wells
The glove80 and some other keyboards make use of so called concave keywells. The ijdea behind this is that each finger has a different length and bends inwards and upwards differently.  If this is done well it results in greatly increased comfort when trying to reach keys on your keboard as they are positioned better for each finger. 

A downside of this approach is that we all have different sized hands so the curvature of a certain board might not suit you very well resulting in worse comfort than you would have.


## Programmable 
Lots of these kind of split keyboards are programmable, this means they contain a little microcontroller that runs usually [[ZMK firmware]] or [[QMK Firmware]]. This lets you fully customize what each key actually does without having to rely on software running on the systems you will use the keyboards on. Want to use an alternative keyboard lay-out? Just program it in and you are good to go. 
### Layers
The shift key is an example of a layer, when you hold shift all the other letter keys become capitalized. Now consider the possibility of programming your own layers that can be activated at will. You can make a number layer, a symbol layer, a nav layer, and, whatever else your heart my desire. 

Personally I primarly make use of a number and symbol layer, as such:

I am making use of a "Layer Tap" , which means if the delete key gets tapped, it will act as a delete button, however, when held it will turn the right side of my keyboard into a number layer. This same concept can be applied in lots of different ways, you can be creative with it.

Mind you I don't use [[Qwerty Layout]]
